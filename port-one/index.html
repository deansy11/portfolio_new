        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>I'm a software developer currently living in Washington, D.C. Before coming here to pursue a career in programming, I was a cheesemaker at a dairy just outside of Seattle, WA, and before that, was the Agricultural Program Director for an environmental non-profit in Upstate NY. I'm passionate about social and environmental advocacy and love to learn new ways to approach challenges and solve problems. I have experience and training in both sides of the development stack, but am particularly passionate about Ruby-on-Rails and JavaScript. What's next?</p>
